# Workflow

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

If you're going to be writing a lot of Shiny apps (and since you're reading this book you hopefully will be!), it's worth investing some time in the basic Shiny app writing workflow. By spending a little time optimising the iteration cycle so that you can make a change and see the results as quickly as possible, you'll find creating apps more pleasant, and your skills will improve more rapidly.

## Basic structure

It's hard to show the basic structure of an app in a book, but so far I've been assuming that you're putting all your code in a single file[^older-structure] called `app.R` that has the following basic structure:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  ...
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

[^older-structure]: Older versions of Shiny used separate files for the front end (`ui.R`) and back end (`server.R`). That organisation continues to work, but is no longer recommended: if you have an older app, I recommend doing a little copy and paste to combine the two files into a single `app.R`.

If you get sick of typing that code in, RStudio provides a couple of shortcuts to help you:

* If you already have your future `app.R` open, type `shinyapp` then press 
  `Shift` + `Tab` to insert the shinyapp snippet.[^snippet]

* If you want to start a new project, go to the File menu, select "New Project"
  then select "Shiny Web Aplication":

    ```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
    knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/action-workflow/new-project.png", dpi = 300)
    ```

[^snippet]: Snippets are text macros that you can use to insert common code fragments. See <https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204463668-Code-Snippets> for more details.

## Basic workflow

For all development activities, I strongly recommend that you spend some time optimising your iteration speed. How short can you make the cycle between making a change and seeing the outcome? The fastest you can iterate, the fast you can experiment, and the faster you can become a better Shiny developer.

The first way to reduce your iteration time is to learn the keyboard shortcut for launching an app: `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter`. You can, of course, click the run app button, but I recommend learning the keyboard shortcut because it's faster in the long run. This gives you a basic workflow like:

* Write some code
* Launch the app with `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter`
* Interactively experiment
* Close the app
* Repeat

Another way to reduce your iteration speed still further is to turn autoreload on (`options(shiny.autoreload = TRUE)`) and then run the app in a background job, as described in <https://github.com/sol-eng/background-jobs/tree/master/shiny-job>. With this workflow as soon as you save a file, your app will relaunch: no needed to close and restart. This leads to an even faster workflow:

* Write some code and press `Cmd/Ctrl` + `S` to save to the file.
* Interactively experiment
* Repeat

As you app gets bigger and bigger you'll find that the "interactively experiment" step starts to become onerous. It's too hard to remember to re-check every component of your app that you might have affected with your changes. Later, you'll learn two tools that help you with this challenge:

* Modules, which help you isolate parts of your app into self-contained 
  fragments. Modules are guaranteed to be de-coupled from the rest of your
  app so you can experiment with them in isolation. Modifying an module can 
  not affect the rest of your app; modifying your app can't affect the 
  internals of your module.
  
* Automated testing, which allows you to turn the interactive experiments 
  you're running into code so that you can both re-run it more quickly (because
  it's automated), and you're guaranteed to check for exactly the same behaviour
  every time (because you don't need to rely on fragile human memory).

## Debugging

Debugging shiny apps is often challenging because reactive code is run out of order. There are two debugging techniques that you're already familiar with that you can continue to use with Shiny code:

*   Use `message()` to emit messages to the console that allow you to see 
    exactly when code is run. You can put messages in any reactive expression 
    or output, just make sure they're not the last line (otherwise they'll
    become the value used by the reactive expression or output). 
  
    If you're outputting multiple values, you might find the
    [glue](http://glue.tidyverse.org/) package useful; it makes it very easy
    to create informative text strings.
  
*   You can use RStudio breakpoints and `browser()` to pause execution and get
    an interactive environment where you can inspect the current values of 
    reactive components.
