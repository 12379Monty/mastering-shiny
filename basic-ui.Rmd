## Introduction

Now that you've got a basic app under your belt, we're going to explore the details that make it tick. As you saw in the previous chapter, Shiny encourages separation of the code that generates your user interface, or frontend, from the code that drives your app's behavior, or backend. In this chapter, we'll dive deeper into the frontend and explore the HTML inputs, outputs, and layouts that are provided by shiny.

Learning more about frontend will allow you to generate visually compelling, but simple apps. In the next chapter, you'll learn more about the reactivity the powers shiny's backend, allowing you to create richer responses to interaction.

```{r setup}
library(shiny)
```

## Inputs {#inputs}

As we saw in the previous chapter, you use functions like `sliderInput()`, `selectInput()`, `textInput()`, and `numericInput()` to insert input controls into your UI specification. Now we'll discuss the common structure that underlies all input functions, then give a quick overview of the most important functions.

### Common structure

All input functions have the same first argument: `inputId`. This is the identifier used to connect the frontend with the backend: if your UI specification creates an input with ID `"name"`, you'll access it in the server function with `input$name`.

The `inputId` has two constraints:

* It must be a simple string that contains only letters, numbers, and 
  underscores (no spaces, dashes, periods, or other special characters 
  allowed!). Name it like you name variables in R.
  
* It must be be unique. If it's not unique, you'll have no way to refer to 
  this control in your server function!

Most input functions have a second parameter called `label`. This is used to create create a human-readable label for the control. Shiny doesn't place any restrictions on this string, but you'll need to carefully think about to make sure that your app is usable by humans! 

The third parameter is typically `value`, which, where possible, lets you set the default value.

The remaining parameters are unique to the control. We'll show the most important parameters for each control below, but you'll need to read to the documentation to get the full details, and to see the less commonly features.

When creating an input, we recommending supplying the `inputId` and `label` arguments by position, and all other arguments by name:

```{r, results = FALSE}
sliderInput("min", "Limit (minimum)", value = 50, min = 0, max = 100)
```

Next, we'll give a quick overview of the most important controls. The goal is to give you a rapid overview of your options, not to exhaustively describe all the arguments. Refer to the documentation for more details. 

### Free text

Collect small amounts of text with `textInput()`, passwords with `passwordInput()`[^password], and paragraphs of text with `textAreaInput()`.

[^password]: Be very careful when collecting confidential information from the user. You need to take great care not to accidentally expose the secret, so we don't recommend using passwords unless you have had some training in secure programming.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("name", "What's your name?"),
  passwordInput("password", "What's your password?"),
  textAreaInput("story", "Tell me about yourself", rows = 3, cols = 80)
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
app <- testApp(ui)
app$setInputs(name = "Joe")
app$setInputs(password = "mypassword")
app_screenshot(app, "basic-ui/free-text")
```

If you want to ensure that the text has certain properties you can use `validate()`, which we'll come back to in Chapter XYZ. 

### Numeric inputs

To collect numeric values, create a slider with `sliderInput()` or a constrained textbox with `numericInput()`. If you supply a length-2 numeric vector for the default value of `sliderInput()`, you get a "range" slider with two ends.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput("num", "Number one", value = 0, min = 0, max = 100),
  sliderInput("num2", "Number two", value = 50, min = 0, max = 100),
  sliderInput("rng", "Range", value = c(10, 20), min = 0, max = 100)
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
ui_screenshot(ui, "basic-ui/numeric")
```

Generally, use sliders for small ranges, where the precise value is not so important. Attempting to precisely select a number on a small slider is an exercise in frustration!

### Dates

Collect a single with `dateInput()`, or a range of two days with `dateRangeInput()`. These provide a convenient calendar picker, and additional arguments like `datesdisabled` and `daysofweekdisabled` allow you to restrict the set of valid inputs.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  dateInput("dob", "When were you born?"),
  dateRangeInput("holdiay", "When do you want to go on vacation next?")
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
ui_screenshot(ui, "basic-ui/date")
```

If you are creating an app for non-Americans, you should also set `format`, `language`, and `weekstart` to ensure that the dates appear naturally to your users.

### Limited choices

There are two different approaches to allow the user to choose from a prespecified set of options: `selectInput()` and `radioButtons()`. 

```{r}
animals <- c("dog", "cat", "mouse", "bird", "other", "I hate animals")

ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput("state", "What's your favourite state?", state.name),
  radioButtons("animal", "What's your favourite animal?", animals)
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
ui_screenshot(ui, "basic-ui/limited-choices")
```

Radio buttons have two nice features: they show all possible options, making them suitable for short lists, and via the `choiceNames`/`choiceValues` arguments, they can display options other than plain text:

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  radioButtons("rb", "Choose one:",
    choiceNames = list(
      icon("angry"),
      icon("smile"),
      icon("sad-tear")
    ),
    choiceValues = list("angry", "happy", "sad")
  )
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
ui_screenshot(ui, "basic-ui/radio-icon")
```

Dropdowns created with `selectInput()` take up the same amount of space, regardless of the number of options, making them more suitable for longer options. You can also set `multiple = TRUE` to allow the user to select multiple elements from the list of possible values.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  selectInput(
    "state", "What's your favourite state?", state.name,
    multiple = TRUE
  )
)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
# Doesn't work: https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest/issues/262
app <- testApp(ui)
app$setInputs(state = "Texas")
app$setInputs(`state-selectized` = "Cali")
app_screenshot(app, "basic-ui/limited-choices-multi")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("images/basic-ui/multi-select.png", dpi = 300)
```

There's no way to select multiple values with radios buttons, but there's an alternative that's conceptually similar: `checkboxInputGroup()`.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  checkboxGroupInput("animal", "What animals do you like?", animals)
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
ui_screenshot(ui, "basic-ui/multi-radio")
```

### Yes/no questions

If you want a single checkbox for a single yes/no question, use `checkboxInput()`:

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  checkboxInput("cleanup", "Clean up?", value = TRUE),
  checkboxInput("shutdown", "Shutdown?")
)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
ui_screenshot(ui, "basic-ui/yes-no")
```

### File uploads and action buttons

We'll come back to two input controls in later chapters: 

* We'll cover `fileInput()` when we discuss uploading and downloading files 
  in Chaper XYZ
  
* We'll cover `actionButton()` when we discuss buttons, controlling 
  side-effects, and initiating "actions" in Chapter XYZ.

## Outputs {#outputs}

Output functions in the UI specification create placeholders that are filled by the server function. Like inputs, outputs take a unique ID as their first argument: if your UI specification creates an output with ID `"plot"`, you'll access it in the server function with `output$plot`. Each `output` function on the frontend is coupled with a `render` function in the backend, like `output$plot <- renderPlot({...})`. 

There are three main types of output, corresponding to the three things you usually include in a report: text, tables, and plots. The following sections show you the basics of the output functions on the frontend, along with the corresponding `render` functions in the backend.

### Text

Output regular text with `textOutput()` and code with `verbatimTextOutput()`. 

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textOutput("text"),
  verbatimTextOutput("code")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$text <- renderText("Hello friend!")
  output$code <- renderPrint(summary(1:10))
}
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
app_screenshot(testApp(ui, server), "basic-ui/output-text")
```

Note that there are two render functions that can used with either of the text ouput functions:

* `renderText()` which displays text _returned_ by the code.
* `renderPrint()` which displays text _printed_ by the code.

To help understand the difference, examine at the the following function. It prints `a` and `b`, and returns `c`:

```{r}
print_and_return <- function() {
  print("a")
  print("b")
  print("c")
}
print_and_return()
```

Note that a function can print multiple things, but can only return a single value.

### Tables

There are two options for displaying data frames in tables:

* `tableOutput()` and `renderTable()` render a static table of data, 
  showing all the data at once.
  
* `dataTableOutput()` and `renderDataTable()` render a dynamic table, where
  only a fixed number of rows are shown at once, and the user can interact to
  see more.
  
`tableOutput()` is most useful for small, fixed summaries (e.g. model coefficients); `dataTableOutput()` is most appropriate if you want to expose a complete data frame to the user.
  
```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  tableOutput("static"),
  dataTableOutput("dynamic")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$static <- renderTable(head(mtcars))
  output$dynamic <- renderDataTable(mtcars, options = list(pageLength = 5))
}
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
app_screenshot(testApp(ui, server), "basic-ui/output-table")
```

### Plots

You can display any type of R graphic with `plotOutput()` and `renderPlot()`:

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  plotOutput("plot", width = "400px")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot(plot(1:5))
}
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
app_screenshot(testApp(ui, server), "basic-ui/output-plot")
```

By default, `plotOutput()` will take up the full width of the element it's embedded within (more on that shortly), and will be 400 pixels high. You can override these defaults with the `height` and `width` arguments.

Plots are specially because they can also act as inputs. `plotOutput()` has a number of arguments like `click`, `dblclick`, and `hover`. If you pass these a string, like `click = "plot_click"`, they'll create a reactive input (`input$plot_click`) that you can use to handle user interaction on the plot. We'll come back to that idea in Chapter XYZ.

## Layouts {#layout}

Now that you know how to create a full range of inputs and outputs, you need to be able to arrange within your app. That's the job of the layout functions, which provide the high-level visual structure of an app. 

Here we'll focus on `fluidPage()`, which provides the layout style used by most apps. In future chapters you'll learn about other layout families like dashboards and dialog boxes.

### Overview

Layouts are created by a heirarchy of function calls, where the hierarchy in R matchs the hierarchy in the output. When you see complex layout code like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Hello Shiny!"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput("obs", "Observations:", min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500)
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("distPlot")
    )
  )
)
```

First skim it by focusing on the hierarchy of the function calls:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fluidPage(
  titlePanel(),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput("obs")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("distPlot")
    )
  )
)
```

Even without knowing anying about the layout functions you can read the function names to guess what this app is going to look like. You can imagine that this is going to generate a classic app design: a title bar at top, followed by a sidebar (containing a slider) and a main panel containing a plot.

### Page functions

You've already seen the most important layout function: `fluidPage()`. It's what we've used in all the examples to put multiple inputs or outputs into a single app. A page function looks boring, because it doesn't display anything:

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage()
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("images/basic-app/fluid-page.png", dpi = 300)
```

But behind the scenes, it's doing a lot of work setting up the HTML, CSS, and JS that shiny needs. `fluidPage()` uses a layout system called **Bootstrap**, <https://getbootstrap.com>, that provides attractive defaults. Later on, in Chapter XYZ, we'll talk about how you can use a little knowledge of bootstrap in order to make your app look more polished.

Technically, `fluidPage()` is all you need for an app, because you can put inputs and outputs directly inside of it. While this is fine for teaching, if you want your app to look good, you'll need to use more layout functions. Here I'll introduce you to two common structures: a page with sidebars, and a multirow app; then we'll finish off with a quick discussion of themes.

### Page with sidebar

`sidebarLayout()` makes it easy to create a two-column layout with inputs on the left and outputs on the right. The basic structure looks like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fluidPage(
  headerPanel(
    # app title/description
  ),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      # inputs
    ),
    mainPanel(
      # outputs
    )
  )
)
```

And generates an app with this basic structure:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/basic-ui/sidebar.png", dpi = 300)
```

We can use this layout to create a very simple app that demonstrates the central limit thereom. If you run this app yourself, you can see how increasing the number of samples makes a distribution that looks very similar a normal distrubtion.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  headerPanel("Central limit theorem"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      numericInput("m", "Number of samples:", 2, min = 1, max = 100)
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("hist")
    )
  )
)
server <- function(input, output, server) {
  output$hist <- renderPlot({
    means <- replicate(1e4, mean(runif(input$m)))
    hist(means, breaks = 20)
  })
}
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = NULL}
app <- testApp(ui, server)
app$expectUpdate("hist")
app_screenshot(app, "basic-ui/sidebar", width = 800)
```

### Multi-row

You'll need greater flexibilty for more complex apps, and the next step up in complexity in the multirow layout. This is defined by any number of `fluidRow()` calls, each of which contains one or more `column()`s. The basic structure looks like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(4, 
      ...
    ),
    column(8, 
      ...
    )
  ),
  fluidRow(
    column(6, 
      ...
    ),
    column(6, 
      ...
    )
  )
)
```

which generates a layout like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/basic-ui/multirow.png", dpi = 300)
```

Column widths must add up to 12, but this still gives you substantial flexibility. You can easily create 2-, 3-, or 4- column layouts (more than that starts to get cramped), or sidebars that are narrower or wider than the default in `sidebarLayout()`.

### Themes

Later on in Chapter XYZ, we'll come back to precisely how you might customise your shiny app. And this is a great thing to do if you are working in a company with a well defined style guide: viewers will be instantly impressed if your app matches your corporate brand identity.  But before you invest the time in creating your own theme, there's an easy way to make your app look different to the default: use a theme from the shinythemes package.  

```{r, results = FALSE}
theme_demo <- function(theme) {
  fluidPage(
    theme = shinythemes::shinytheme(theme),
    sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
        textInput("txt", "Text input:", "text here"),
        sliderInput("slider", "Slider input:", 1, 100, 30)
      ),
      mainPanel(
        h1("Header 1"),
        h2("Header 2"),
        p("Some text")
      )
    )
  )
}
theme_demo("darkly")
theme_demo("flatly")
theme_demo("sandstone")
theme_demo("united")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "45%", fig.show="hold"}
ui_screenshot(theme_demo("darkly"), "basic-ui/theme-darkly")
ui_screenshot(theme_demo("flatly"), "basic-ui/theme-flatly")
ui_screenshot(theme_demo("sandstone"), "basic-ui/theme-sandstone")
ui_screenshot(theme_demo("united"), "basic-ui/theme-united")
```

As you can see, theming your app is quite straightforward: you just need to use the `theme` argument to `fluidPage()`. The easiest way to see what the themes bundled in the shinythemes packages looks like is to play around with the shiny theme selector app at <https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/shiny-theme-selector.html>.

## Under the hood

In the previous example you might've been surprised to see that I used a function. But shiny code is just R code, so you still have all of your tools for reducing duplication. Remember the rule of three: if you copy and paste code more than three times, you should consider writing a function or using a for loop (or a map/apply function).

All web pages are constructed out of HTML, and Shiny user interfaces are no different---although they are generally expressed using R, their ultimate job is to produce HTML. As a Shiny app author, you can use high-level layout functions in R that keep you far away from the details of HTML. You can also work with HTML tags directly to achieve any level of customization you want. These approaches are by no means exclusive; you can mix high-level functions with low-level HTML as much as you like.

while Chapter \@ref(advanced-ui) will delve into using lower-level features for authoring HTML directly.

They're just functions that return HTML.

```{r, raw_html = TRUE}
fluidPage()
```

So if you notice a common pattern in your apps you can easily construct your own function. Producing with inputs and outputs is a little trickier in a function because of the need for unique IDs. Fixing this problem is the motivation for Shiny modules, which we'll come back to in Chapter XYZ.
