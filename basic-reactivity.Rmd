## Introduction

In the the last chapter, we talked about creating the user interfaces. Now we'll move on to discuss the server side of Shiny, where you use R code at runtime to make your user interface come to life!

In Shiny, you express your server logic using reactive programming. Reactive programming is an elegant and powerful programming paradigm, but it can be disorienting at first because it's a very different paradigm to writing a script. The key idea of reactive programming is to specify a graph of dependencies so that when an input changes, all outputs are automatically updated. This makes the flow of an app considerably simpler, but it takes a while to get your head around how it all fits together.

This chapter will provide a gentle walkthrough of reactive programming, introducing some of the most basic reactive constructs you'll use in your Shiny apps. We'll start with a survey of the server function, discussing in more detail how the `input` and `output` arguments work. Next we'll review the simplest form of reactivity (where inputs are directly connected to outputs), and then discuss how reactive expressions allow you to eliminate duplicated work. We'll finish by reviewing some common roadblocks encountered by newer shiny users.

```{r setup}
library(shiny)
```

## The server function

As you've seen, the typical Shiny app boilerplate looks like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  # Front-end interface
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # Back-end logic
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

As you learned in the last chapter, the front-end is a single object containing HTML code. It is fixed and static, and presented to the same to every user of your app.

The backend is more complex: `server()` is function that you define and pass to `shinyApp()`, along with the UI. You'll never call a server function yourself; rather, Shiny invokes it whenever a new session begins, and almost of the reactive programming you'll do in Shiny will be inside the server function[^exceptions]. 

[^exceptions]: The primary exception is where there's some work that can shared across multiple users. For example, all users might be looking at the same large csv file, so you might as well load it once and share it between users. We'll come back to that idea in Chapter XYZ.

To understand why shiny has a server function, you need to first understand the idea of browser __session__, which captures the state of one live instance of a shiny app. A session begins each time the Shiny app is loaded in a browser, either by different people, or by the same person opening multiple tabs. 

The server function is called once for each browser session, creating a private scope for that particular session, encapsulating the unique state. Every variable created inside the server function is only accessible to a single session. This ensures that when user A moves a slider, outputs update only for user A, not user B. 

Server functions take three parameters: `input`, `output`, and `session`[^session-optional]. You'll never create these objects yourself; instead, they're created by Shiny when the session begins. Each combination of the three arguments connects back to a specific session, and you use those objects to communicate back and forth with the browser. For the moment, we'll focus on `input` and `output`, and leave `session` for later chapters.

[^session-optional]: For legacy reasons, `session` is optional, but you should always include it.

### Input {#input}

The `input` object is a list-like object that contains all the input data sent from the browser, stored by input ID. For example, if your UI contains a numeric input control with an input ID of `count`:

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput("count", label = "Number of values", value = 100)
)
```

then you can access the value of that input with `input$count`. It will initially contain the value `100`, and it will be automatically updated as the user changes the value in the browser.

Unlike a typical list, `input` objects are read-only. If you attempt to modify an input inside the server function, you'll get an error:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  input$count <- 10  
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
#> Error: Attempted to assign value to a read-only reactivevalues object
```

This error occurs because `input` reflects what's happening in the browser, where the browser is the "single source of truth". If you could modify the value in R, it would be possible to have introduce inconsistencies where the input slider said one thing in the browser, and `input$count` said something different. That would make programming very complicated.

It is possible, however, to change the value in the browser using `updateNumericInput()` and friends, and then `input$count` will update accordingly. We'll come back to that idea in Chapter XYZ, where we discuss dynamic user interfaces.

One more important thing about `input`: it's selective about who is allowed to read it. You must be in a __reactive context__ to be able to access it. We'll come back to that idea very shortly, but it's a fundamentally important idea that allows outputs to automatically update when an input changes. For example, this server function will also fail:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  message("The value of input$count is ", input$count)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
#> Error: Operation not allowed without an active reactive context. 
#> (You tried to do something that can only be done from inside 
#> a reactive expression or observer.)
```

This is likely to surprise you when you first start using Shiny. But this selectivity is extremely important as it allows shiny to automatically figure out how inputs and outputs are connected in order to automatically figure out what needs to be updated when ever an input changes.

### Output {#output}

Shiny UIs inputs and outputs. As you've seen in the last chapter, the various `*Output` UI functions---`plotOutput()`, `tableOutput()`, `textOutput()`, and friends---merely insert empty boxes, or placeholders, into your UI. The `output` object allows you to populate these these empty boxes.

You always use the `output` object in concert with a `render` function. The render function does two things:

* It sets up a reactive context that automatically tracks what inputs 
  you use.
  
* It converts the output of your R code into HTML suitable for display
  in the output control.

Take an even simpler example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textOutput("greeting")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    "Hello human!"
  })
}
```

(Note that the ID is quoted in the UI, but not in the server.)

Like the `input`, the `output` is picky about how you access it. If you forget the `render` function you'll get an error:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- "Hello human"
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
#> Error: Unexpected character output for greeting
```

And if you attempt to read from an output you'll get an error:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  message("The greeting is ", output$greeting)
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
#> Error: Reading objects from shinyoutput object not allowed.
```

### Imperative vs. declarative

When looking at 

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$greeting <- renderText({
    "Hello human!"
  })
}
```

It's easy to read this as generate the text then send it to `output$greeting`. But this intuition is wrong, in a subtle but important way. This code does not _instruct_ Shiny to render the plot and send it to the browser, but instead, tells Shiny _how it could_ render the plot, if it needs to. 

This is the difference between __imperative__ programming, where you tell R what you want it to do, and it immediately does it, and and _declarative_ programming, where you tell R what your primary goal is, and it figure out the best way to achieve it. 

This is like the difference between base graphics where you tell R: draw a line here, draw some points there, and ggplot2, where you describe how you want to map variables in your data to visual properties.

Imperative programming is about issuing specific commands, to be carried out immediately. Declarative programming is about expressing some higher-level goals or constraints, and relying on someone else (in this case, Shiny) to decide how and/or when to translate that into action.

Imperative code say: "Make me a sandwich."

Declarative code says: "Ensure there is a sandwich in the refrigerator whenever I look inside of it." (Sorry, sometimes Declarative can be a passive-aggressive jerk.)

The correct, declarative reading of the code snippet above is "Whenever you want to render the `greeting` output, know that it's text coming from the R code "greeting". 

It's totally up to Shiny whether and when to actually render the plot; maybe right away, maybe quite a bit later, maybe many times, maybe never. This isn't to imply that Shiny is capricious and arbitrary, only that it's Shiny's responsibility, not yours, to decide when render logic is actually executed.

Much like ggplot2, 95% of the time this is tremendously freeing: you describe your overall goals, and shiny and ggplot2 achieve them without further intervention. The downside is that 5% of the time where you just want to say "DO THIS! DO IT NOW" and you can't figure out how to describe your simple instructions into a set of motivations that ggplot2 or shiny can understand.

## Using inputs and outputs together {#inputs-and-outputs}

The above rendering logic, `hist(rnorm(100))`, isn't very exciting; the user can't interact with this app in any way (unless you count reloading the browser, which would generate a new batch of values). Let's modify the output to use the input. The complete app is below:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  numericInput("count", label = "Number of values", value = 100),
  plotOutput("hist_plot")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$hist_plot <- renderPlot({
    # Choose input$count random values from a normal distribution,
    # and create a histogram
    hist(rnorm(input$count))
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Run this app, and you'll notice that as you change the `count` input, the output updates immediately. This is reactive programming at work! When one thing (`input$count`) changes, other things (`output$hist_plot`) automatically and immediately respond.

Let's see what happens if we add a few more inputs and outputs. In this next example, we've added a new input that affects the histogram: `input$bins` is used to specify the number of bins in the histogram. We've also added a table output, that limits itself to displaying the first `input$rows` of the data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    column(4, 
      numericInput("count", label = "Number of values", value = 100),
      numericInput("bins", label = "Bins", value = 10)
    ),
    column(8, plotOutput("hist_plot"))
  ),
  fluidRow(
    column(4, numericInput("rows", label = "Rows to show", value = 5)),
    column(8, tableOutput("value_table"))
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$hist_plot <- renderPlot({
    # Choose input$count random values from a normal distribution,
    # and create a histogram
    values <- rnorm(input$count)
    hist(values, breaks = input$bins, xlim = c(-3, 3))
  })
  
  output$value_table <- renderTable({
    # Choose input$count random values from a normal distribution,
    # and display the first input$rows
    values <- rnorm(input$count)
    data.frame(head(values, input$rows))
  }, colnames = FALSE)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

By careful inspection of the code, we can see that `input$count` affects both outputs, while `input$bins` affects only the plot and `input$rows` affects only the table. Run the app, and you'll see that Shiny knows this too. If you change `input$bins`, the plot is affected but the table is not. If you change `input$rows`, the table is affected but the plot is not. 

As your shiny apps get more complex, you'll find that carefully drawing out the graph of reactive inputs and outputs helps you to understand what's going on. The following diagram introduces you to the basic conventions we'll use throughout this book.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/basic-reactivity/input-output.png", dpi = 300)
```

The point of this example is to demonstrate that Shiny doesn't simply re-render all of its outputs whenever an input has changed. Somehow, without a lot of help from us, Shiny figures out which inputs should affect which outputs. This is the most "magical" aspect of reactive programming, and we'll eventually pull back the curtain; for now, just trust that it works.

### Outputs are atomic

Shiny is smart enough to discern that an output needs to be updated. However, it's not nearly smart enough to know if it can get away with running only part of the output's code block. For example, the code for `hist_plot` has two lines:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
values <- rnorm(input$count)
hist(values, breaks = input$bins)
```

As a human looking at this code, you might conclude that when `input$bins` changes, it's not necessary to re-run both lines; if we still had access to the existing `values` variable, merely running the second line might be enough.

Shiny doesn't try to be this clever. Instead, an output's render code block is always executed in its entirety, whether it's two lines of code or two hundred. In this way, each output represents an indivisible unit.

### Reactive expressions {#reactive-expressions-intro}

If you read the code above carefully you might have noticed that we're actually generating the random numbers in two different places. The table and the histogram are actually displaying the results from two unrelated datasets! To fix that problem we need to introduce one more big idea: the reactive expression. 

But first let's look at two approaches that don't work.

Using a variable won't work:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Don't do this!
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  dataset <- get(input$dataset, "package:datasets", inherits = FALSE)

  output$summary <- renderPrint({
    summary(dataset)
  })
  
  output$table <- renderTable({
    dataset
  })
}
```

In this code, we're attempting to calculate the value of `dataset` just once, as the session starts. But the value of `input$dataset` may change over time. We noted a few paragraphs ago that Shiny outputs are reactive (they re-execute as necessary); the same cannot be said for free-floating code like this. So the result of extracting a variable like this is tha the `dataset` variable will assume some value at startup based on the initial value of `input$dataset`, and stay at that value forever. This is clearly not what we want, and is such an easy trap to fall into that in fact Shiny detects this condition and throws an error immediately.

If using a variable won't work, how about a function? This will work, and takes care of the code duplication, but it does result in duplicated effort:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Don't do this!
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  getDataset <- function() {
    get(input$dataset, "package:datasets", inherits = FALSE)
  }

  output$summary <- renderPrint({
    summary(getDataset())
  })
  
  output$table <- renderTable({
    getDataset()
  })
}
```

We get the correct behavior this time, at least—we're calling `getDataset()` from within our output code, so Shiny will know to recalculate the outputs when `input$dataset` changes. However, for each change to `input$dataset`, `getDataset` is going to be called twice, and its work is therefore going to be performed twice. (In this example, the work being done in `getDataset` is totally trivial so it doesn't actually matter; just imagine we're doing a more expensive operation like retrieving a dataset from a web service or database, or fitting a model over a large dataset, or performing simulations.)


A reactive expression is created using `reactive()`. It ordinary R code, and makes it reactive so that it automatically updates when it's inputs change. To use a reactive input, you call it like a function.

```{r}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  values <- reactive({
    rnorm(input$count)
  })
  
  output$hist_plot <- renderPlot({
    hist(values(), breaks = input$bins)
  })
  
  output$value_table <- renderTable({
    data.frame(head(values(), input$rows))
  })
}
```

This leads to the following reactivity diagram. You can see that we're starting to develop a more complex graph. We'll come back to exactly how events flow through this graph, and how Shiny ensures that it does the smallest amount of work in Chapter \@ref(reactivity-mental-model).

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/basic-reactivity/input-reactive-output.png", dpi = 300)
```

Reactive expressions are extremely important for creating efficient shiny apps because they are only updated when their inputs change. This means that you can use them to encapsulate expensive operations so that they are only re-computed the minimal number of times. If you have every used a tool like `make`, this might seem familiar.

To summarize: while variables calculate the value only once (not often enough), and functions calculate the value every time they're called (too often), reactive expressions calculate the value only when it might have changed (just right!).


## Controlling effect flow

### Side effects

Simulation example - if the simulation is slow, you don't want to kick it off as soon as you make one little change. Two approaches: you could throttle, or you could make a button.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
data <- eventReactive(input$go, {
  rnorm(input$n, input$mean, input$sd)
})
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data <- eventReactive(
  throttle(list(input$n, input$mean, input$sd), 250), 
  rnorm(input$n, input$mean, input$sd)
)
```

### Timed invalidation

The flip side is that sometimes you need to update the app when something outside has changed. i.e. you need to invalid more often that the reactivity graph would otherwise suggest.

```{r}
ui <- fluidPage(
  textOutput("time")
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  time <- reactive({
    invalidateLater(1000)
    as.character(Sys.time())
  })
  
  output$time <- renderText(time())
}
```

Later on you'll learn about tools like `reactiveFileReader()`
