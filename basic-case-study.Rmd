## Introduction

In the last three chapters, we've introduced you to a bunch of new concepts. To help them sink in, we'll now walk through how you might create a shiny app to facilitate the exploration of a datasets.

In this chapter, we're going to supplement Shiny with the tidyverse and vroom packages.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(vroom)
library(shiny)
```

## The data

We're going to explore a year's worth of data from the Data from National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). This is a long-term study that captures accidents from a representative probability sample of all hospitals in the United States. Collected by Consumer Product Safety Commission. 

You can find out more about this dataset at <https://github.com/hadley/neiss>, and see the code used to create this extract at <>.

The main dataset we'll look at is `injuries`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
injuries <- vroom::vroom("neiss/injuries.tsv.gz")
injuries
```

* `trmt_date`, date that person was seen in the hospital.
* `age`, `sex`, and `race` give demographic information about the person
* `body_part` and `diag` give information about the injury
* `location` is the place where it occurred
* `prod_code` is the primary product associated with the injury.
* `weight` is statistical weight giving the estimated number of people who
  would suffer this injury if scaled to the entire population of the US.
* `narrative` is a brief story about how the accident occurred.

We'll pair it with two other data frames for additional context: `products` lets us look up the product name from the produce code, and population tells us the total population of the US for each age and sex combination.

```{r, message = FALSE}
products <- vroom::vroom("neiss/products.tsv")
products

population <- vroom::vroom("neiss/population.tsv")
population
```

## Exploration

Let's take a look at the product code associated with the most injuries - 1842, "stairs or steps". First we'll pull out just this subset of the data:

```{r}
selected <- injuries %>% filter(prod_code == 1842)
nrow(selected)
```

And then perform some basic summaries - steps are most often associated with stairs, to the ankle, at home. Note that I'm weighting my counts with the `weight` variable: that allows us to interpret the counts as estimate number across the whole US.

```{r}
selected %>% count(diag, wt = weight, sort = TRUE)

selected %>% count(body_part, wt = weight, sort = TRUE)

selected %>% count(location, wt = weight, sort = TRUE)
```

We can also explore the pattern across age and sex. Here I also standardise by population so we can get the estimate number of injuries per 10,000 people of that age-sex group.

```{r}
summary <- selected %>% 
  count(age, sex, wt = weight) %>% 
  left_join(population, by = c("age", "sex")) %>% 
  mutate(rate = n / population * 1e4)
summary
```

```{r}
summary %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, n, colour = sex)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(y = "Estimated number of injuries")
```

Interestingly, the number of injuries is much higher for women.

```{r}
summary %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age, rate, colour = sex)) + 
  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE) + 
  labs(y = "Injuries per 10,000 people")
```

There are three broad patterns here: there's a big spike when children are learning to walk, and roughly constant rate from 20 to 70, and then a gradual increase. This pair of plots shows why considering the rate is so important: the number of injuries to older people declines sharply, but that mostly reflects the fact that fewer people are alive. (Note that the rates only go up to age 80; I couldn't find population data for 80-100.)

We can take a look at a random sample of the narratives to see if that holds true:

```{r}
selected %>% 
  sample_n(10) %>% 
  pull(narrative)
```

It would be very nice if we could easily do this exploration for each product code, without having to retype the code. So lets make a shiny app!

## Prototype

I'll start simple with one input (the product code), three tables, and one plot. When thinking about the front-end there's some tension between starting simple, so I can get the basics working before trying something else, and making sure I don't constrain the basic framework of the app too early. I find doing a few sketches with pencil and paper to be a good way to explore the basic structure before committing to the code.

Here I decided to have one row for the inputs (accepting that I'm probably going to add more inputs before this app is done), one row for all three tables (giving each table 4 columns, 1/3 of the 12 column width), and then one row for the plot:

```{r code = section_get("neiss/prototype.R", "ui")}
```

The server function relatively straghtforward: I convert the `selected` and `summary` variables to reactive expressions. This is a reasonable general pattern: you've typically create variables in your data analysis as a way of decomposing the analysis into steps, and avoiding having to recompute things multiple times, and reactive expressions play the same role in Shiny apps. Often it's a good idea to spend a little time cleaning up your analysis code before you start your Shiny app, so you can think about these problems in regular R code, before you add the additional complexity of reactivity.

```{r code = section_get("neiss/prototype.R", "server")}
```

Note in this case `summary` isn't strictly necessary; because it's only used by a single reactive consumer. But it's good practice to keep computing and plotting separate as it makes the flow of the app easier to understand, and will make it easier to generalise in the future.

When prototyping, there's always a tension between doing the minimum amount of work, and planning for the future. Either extreme can be bad: if you design too narrowly, you'll spend a lot of time later on reworking your app; if you design to rigorously, you'll spend a bunch of time on code that later ends up on cutting floor. Getting the balance right is one of the skills of the software engineer, and there are few shortcuts.

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
file.copy("neiss/prototype.R", "neiss/app.R")
app <- shinytest::ShinyDriver$new("neiss")
app_screenshot(app, "basic-case-study/prototype", width = 800, height = 600)
file.remove("neiss/app.R")
```
```{r, out.width = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/basic-case-study/prototype.png")
```

Now that we have the basic components in place, and working, we can progressively improve our app. Below, I'll show the changes that I make at each point; you can find the complete source for each app at <https://github.com/jcheng5/shiny-book/tree/master/neiss>

<!-- TODO: should probably number once final order is fixed -->

## Polish tables

The main problem with this app is that it shows a lot of information in the tables, where we probably just want the highlights. To fix this we need to need to first figure out how to truncate the tables. I've chosen to do that with a combination of forcats functions: I convert the variable to a factor order by the frequency of the levels, and then lump together all levels after the top 5. 

(Exercise: what happens if you flip `fct_infreq()` and `fct_lump()`?)

```{r}
injuries %>%
  mutate(diag := fct_lump(fct_infreq(diag), n = 5)) %>%
  group_by(diag) %>%
  summarise(n = as.integer(sum(weight)))
```

Because I knew how to do it, I wrote a little function to automate this for any variable. The details aren't really important here; and don't worry if this looks totally foreign: you could also solve the problem via copy and paste.

```{r, code = section_get("neiss/polish-tables.R", "count_top")}
```

I then use this in the server function:

```{r, code = section_get("neiss/polish-tables.R", "tables"), eval = FALSE}
```

I made one other change to improve the aesthetics of the app: I forced all tables to take up the maximum width (i.e. fill the column that they appear in). This makes the output more aesthetically pleasing because it reduces the amount of extraneous variaton.

## Rate vs count

So far, we're displaying only a single plot, but we'd like to give the user the choice between visualising the number or visualising the rate. This is a relatively simple change. 

First I add a control to the UI. Here I've chosen to use a `selectInput()`. The primary advantage is that it makes both states explicit, and it would be easy to add new states in the future:

```{r, code = section_get("neiss/rate-vs-count.R", "first-row"), eval = FALSE}
```

And then I condition on that input when generating the plot:

```{r, code = section_get("neiss/rate-vs-count.R", "plot"), eval = FALSE}
```

## Narrative

Finally, I want some way to access the narratives. This gives an informal way to cross-check the hypotheses I come up with for the patterns I see. In the R code, I sample multiple narratives but there's no reason to do that in an app since I can expose an interavtive control.

There are two parts to the solution. First we create a new row in the UI (which I place at the end). I'll use an action button to trigger a new story:

```{r, code = section_get("neiss/narrative.R", "narrative-ui"), eval = FALSE}
```

The result of an action button is an integer that increments each time it's clicked. Here I just use it to trigger a re-execution of the random selection:

```{r, code = section_get("neiss/narrative.R", "narrative-server"), eval = FALSE}
```

(Exercise: rewrite with next and previous button that lets you step through randomly ordered stories/)
